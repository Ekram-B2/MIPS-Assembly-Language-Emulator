# MIPS-Assembly-Language-Emulator
This project is a simple simulator for a subset of MIPS instruction set as defined withinin the textbook ‘Computer Organization and Design: The hardware/Software Interface” 5th Edition, Patterson and Hennessy  The simulator should read the instructions one by one and execute them. Execution of the instructions means changing the contents of registers and/or memory. Your simulator should run the program until the end of the file (executable binary), or until executing a syscall to exit.  The simulator should run in one of two different modes. The first line of the binary code is either 0 or 1. if 0, the simulator simulates the program until the end and then print the contents of the 32 register $0 - $31. If the first line is 1, the simulator prints the contents of the 32 registers after it executes any instruction.
